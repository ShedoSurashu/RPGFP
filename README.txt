I started this project at Feb 17, 2012 (GMT +8:00). Just recording the date. :)

This is my first attempt at making a JRPG flash game engine based on FlashPunk.
This project has room for a LOT of improvements. As I said, this is my very
first. This will be both a growing experience for me and the people who attempt
to try the engine. :P
