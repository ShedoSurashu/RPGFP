### A JRPG framework utilizing FlashPunk.

I started this project at Feb 17, 2012 (GMT +8:00). Just recording the date. :)

This is my first attempt at making a JRPG flash game framework based on FlashPunk. This project has room for a LOT of improvements. As I said, this is my very first. This will be both a growing experience for me and the people who attempt to try the engine. :P

My final goal for this project is for it to have the following.

* Easily use custom maps with the help of the [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) editor.
* Easily implement custom gameplay scripts using XML.
* Easily configure the framework for any minor to major customization needs.
